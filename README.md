# Banking Management

This project aims to create a banking management system that can perform various tasks such as opening accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, transferring funds, checking balance, and generating statements. The project also uses machine learning models to predict customer churn and loan default.

## Data Analysis

The project uses pandas and matplotlib libraries to perform data analysis on the banking dataset. The dataset contains information about customers, accounts, transactions, loans, and credit cards. The data analysis includes:

 Exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, missing values, outliers, and correlations.d
Data preprocessing to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
 Data visualization to plot histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps.

## Machine Learning Models

The project uses two machine learning models to predict customer churn and loan default:

 Decision Tree: A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that splits the data into branches based on certain criteria. The decision tree can handle both numerical and categorical variables, and can also provide interpretable rules for the predictions.
 Naive Bayes: A naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of each class given the features. The naive Bayes assumes that the features are independent of each other, which simplifies the computation.

The project evaluates the performance of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The project also uses cross-validation and grid search to tune the hyperparameters of the models.

## How to Run

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

 pandas
 numpy
 matplotlib
 scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip or conda commands. For example:

bash
pip install pandas


or

bash
conda install pandas


After installing the libraries, you can clone this repository using git command:

bash
git clone https://github.com/username/banking-management.git


Then, you can navigate to the project folder and run the main.py file using python command:

bash
cd banking-management
python main.py


The main.py file will execute the data analysis and machine learning tasks and display the results on the console. You can also view the plots generated by matplotlib in the plots folder.
